# ðŸŽ­ ParaBank E2E Test Automation with Playwright

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

    â€¢ The app itself is inconsistent / intermittent (since it is a public demo application)

â€¢ There are instances that certain functionality is down and not working
(e.g. Find Transactions, logging out after registration then when logs back error is showing, etc.)
â€¢ Test might be affected by the app intermittent functionalities (You would need to wait for a certain time)

## âœ¨ Overview

This project is an **End-to-End (E2E) automation framework** built using **Playwright** for the [ParaBank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/) online banking application. It covers both **UI** and **API** test scenarios to ensure a complete validation of key user workflows.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- TypeScript
- Faker (for generating test data)
- JSON schema validation (for API responses)

## Pre-requisites (IMPORTANT!!)

Make sure NodeJS and GIT is installed in your machine. If not,
You may install and download it here:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Open CMD / VSCode

### 1. Clone the Repository

Make sure to change directory (cd) using the correct repo name below. Same letter casing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smplpz21/PARABANK-PLAYWRIGHT-TYPESCRIPT.git
cd PARABANK-PLAYWRIGHT-TYPESCRIPT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 3. Running tests

Running UI only (chromium)

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ui/sample-test.spec.ts  --headed --project=chromium
```

Run both UI and API (api test is dependent with UI pay bill data)

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### 4. HTML Report

Each test will generate a separate report
execute command below to load report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

    â€¢	All usernames generated during registration are random and unique.
    â€¢	API validations use either Playwrightâ€™s built-in assertions or custom JSON schema checks
    â€¢	Most of UI assertions use Playwright's built-in assertions for best practice
    â€¢	The test suite runs in sequential order to maintain flow between UI and API validations.
